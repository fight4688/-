Stoicism is not as simple as saying it out,you should practice it anytime,anywhere,or what you do can't be called as Stoicism,you can't be a stoic .And ==in Internet-era==,you should pay more attention on yourself to make sure you are on the right way,it's not easy,but once you can achieve it ,you'll get reward more generous than anyone.
